## Exploration
Musical symmetry as a logic system — specifically, non-retrogradable rhythms (palindromic durations) and how tiny constraints generate expressive structure.

## What I made
A micro-composition sketch + generation rule set called Mirror Ladder.

## What surprised me
Even with almost no rhythmic freedom, the piece feels like it is "breathing" because harmonic drift creates perceived acceleration/relaxation without changing tempo.

## Notes
Potential work-relevant idea spotted (constraint-first creativity for ideation systems). Logged only here for now; if still relevant tomorrow, add as a Discovery in MEMORY.md.
