## Exploration
Language as compression — how much narrative can hide inside strict formal constraints.

## What I made
A constrained micro-fiction artifact called **"The Twelve-Word Telescope"**.

## What surprised me
Hard limits (word count + line count) did not shrink imagination; they amplified implication, like turning prose into high-pressure steam.

## Notes
Standalone creative exercise, intentionally unrelated to active projects. If any product insight remains useful tomorrow, log it in MEMORY.md as a Discovery then—not now.
