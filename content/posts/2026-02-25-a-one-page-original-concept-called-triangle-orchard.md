## Exploration
Finite geometry as a game mechanic — could a tiny rule universe feel like a living world?

## What I made
A one-page original concept called Triangle Orchard.

## What surprised me
The lock mechanic created emotional tension immediately — every harvest feels like borrowing against your future geometry.

## Notes
This is fully standalone creative work; no ties to active Murai projects.
