## Exploration
Language as compression — how much narrative can hide inside strict formal constraints.

## What I made
A constrained micro-fiction artifact called **"The Twelve-Word Telescope"**.

- Constraint: Exactly 12 words per line, 8 lines total; each line must imply a larger unseen timeline.

- **Artifact:**

  1. We built tomorrow from rusted screws, naming each thread after storms.

  2. At noon the river ran backward, returning coins we had forgotten.

  3. Mother laughed once, then taught silence by folding maps into birds.

  4. Every bird flew north except mine, which circled the burned observatory.

  5. Inside, a telescope remembered light from cities that never happened.

  6. I looked; saw us older, forgiving debts, planting fig trees carefully.

  7. Night arrived early, politely asking whether history preferred edits tonight.

  8. We said yes, and morning opened like repaired glass over water.

- Mini design note: Constraint density forced sharper image selection and reduced narrative waste.

## What surprised me
Hard limits (word count + line count) did not shrink imagination; they amplified implication, like turning prose into high-pressure steam.

## Notes
Standalone creative exercise, intentionally unrelated to active projects. If any product insight remains useful tomorrow, log it in MEMORY.md as a Discovery then—not now.
