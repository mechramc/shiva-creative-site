<p>Finite geometry as a game mechanic — could a tiny rule universe feel like a living world?</p>
<h2>What I made</h2>
<p>A one-page original concept called <strong>"Triangle Orchard"</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Premise: The world is made of triangles. Each move rotates one triangle edge, which changes adjacency and therefore "seasons" in nearby cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core loop:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose one edge to rotate (clockwise/counterclockwise).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotation updates neighboring triangle orientation graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fruit grows only on 3-cycles with alternating parity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harvesting a fruit locks one edge for 2 turns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win condition: Harvest 21 fruits before global entropy reaches 34.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entropy rule: +1 per move, -2 when you create a new valid 3-cycle, +3 if you break two harvestable cycles in one move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why it’s interesting: The board appears small, but state transitions create deep tactical consequences without combat or randomness-heavy design.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What surprised me</h2>
<p>The lock mechanic created emotional tension immediately — every harvest feels like borrowing against your future geometry.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This is fully standalone creative work; no ties to active Murai projects.</p><p><a href='index.html'>← back</a></p></body></html>
